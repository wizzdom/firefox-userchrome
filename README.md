# My Firefox userchrome configs

Heavily based on [DeepDark for Firefox](https://payhip.com/b/0RXwS) by [Stefano Rosselli](http://stefrosselli.com/)

Used together with [this firefox theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/metro-for-firefox/)

I made this repo mainly for myself to manage syncing changes to my userstyle configs across devices.

This repo only contains the additions I have made to his userstyle (vertical tabs, autohiding vertical tabs etc.).  

If you want to use this userstyle with my customisations, you will need to buy his userstyle here: https://payhip.com/b/0RXwS and add the `resources` folder to the root of this repo.

Thanks to Stefano for this fantastic userstyle
